This is my first project with complete login/registration features, uploading content, and other 'advanced' features. I used firebase-auth system for creating new user with e-mail and password, login with existing e-mail and password or login with Google method. Also, there is an option to set profile picture for user and posting an content. For storing the data I used firebase-firestore.
There aren't many features right now, but there will be soon
